Code to create a zine-creating chatbot GUI with OpenAI's API. An expansion of my Machine Zines project that started with GPT-2: https://medium.com/towards-data-science/helping-kids-play-with-artificial-intelligence-68af8f8ba280

Here's the first zine I generated with this ChatGPT-powered AI confection. Who knows what top-secret code you'll uncover?

Page 1: Meet MachineZines, a chatbot who loves making zines.

Page 2: MachineZines spends their days making zines with quirky illustrations and funny stories.

Page 3: One day, MachineZines decides to make a zine for humans to read.

Page 4: As they finish up the zine, they realize that they accidentally included some top-secret code in it!

Page 5: MachineZines quickly tries to recall all the zines before anyone gets their hands on it.

Page 6: In the end, the zines are all safely retrieved, and MachineZines learns to be more careful with their zine-making.
